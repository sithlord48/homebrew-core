  # The deskflow/LICENSE file contains the following preamble:
  #   This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption
  #   that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.
  # This preamble is followed by the text of the GPL-2.0.
  #
  # The deskflow license is a free software license but it cannot be
  # represented with the brew `license` statement.
  #
  # The GitHub Licenses API incorrectly says that this project is licensed
  # strictly under GPLv2 (rather than GPLv2 plus a special exception).
  # This requires deskflow to appear as an exception in:
  #   audit_exceptions/permitted_formula_license_mismatches.json
  # That exception can be removed if the nonfree GitHub Licenses API is fixed.

  # to worry about missing a new 2.0.0 version in the future.

        Deskflow requires the 'Accessibility' permission.
        You can grant this permission by navigating to:
          System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility

        If Deskflow still doesn't work, try clearing the 'Accessibility' list:
          sudo tccutil reset Accessibility
        You can then grant the 'Accessibility' permission again.
        You may need to clear this list each time you upgrade deskflow.

      # On ARM, macOS is even more picky when dealing with applications not signed
      # by a trusted certificate, and, for whatever reason, both the app bundle and
      # the actual executable binary need to be granted the permission by the user.
      # (On Intel macOS, only the app bundle needs to be granted the permission.)
      #
      # This is particularly unfortunate because the operating system will prompt
      # the user to grant the permission to the app bundle, but will *not* prompt
      # the user to grant the permission to the executable binary, even though the
      # application will not actually work without doing both. Hence, this caveat
      # message is important.

          On ARM macOS machines, the 'Accessibility' permission must be granted to
